\section{Experiences with FF}
\label{sec:crisp-ff}


Things that went wrong with FF:

\begin{enumerate}
\item Enforced hillclimbing: Initial state of example problem has a
  relaxed graph of length one because ``expressed'' and ``subst''
  goals are achieved, and newly introduced violations of ``subst'' and
  ``distractor'' are not noticed. As a consequence, EHC on the second
  state spends all of its time in breadth-first search.
\item Goal agenda: For some reason that I don't understand in detail,
  the goal agenda heuristic can choose that the ``subst'' goal must be
  reached before even the ``expressed'' goal. This leads the planner
  to generating some arbitrary sentence. Because the example grammar
  is so small, this leads to a state from which the ``expressed'' goal
  can no longer be achieved. (A realistic big grammar should be able
  to recover from this by introducing a conjunction or relative clause
  or some such -- but of course, this would still lead to a stupid
  sentence.)
\item No helpful actions in best-first search: After the initial
  failure of the goal agenda, FF fell back to best-first search, but
  didn't use the helpful actions heuristic in this search.
\item Tautology detection in reachability analysis: The old FF
  performed a pairwise comparison of the ground literals in the
  instantiated goal to remove tautologies and obvious contradictions.
  In the sentence generation problems, the instantiated goal can
  contain lots of literals, so this takes a long time.  Removing the
  check helped a lot.  Another way to fix this problem would have been
  to sort the list of ground literals appropriately and then only
  compare neighboring literals.
\item Unnecessary computation of hard action template data structure:
  FF computed a big data structure that was only useful for hard
  action templates, although the sentence generation planning problems
  only contain easy action templates.  Because the universe can be
  relatively big, this again wasted a lot of time.
\end{enumerate}


Other observations:

\begin{enumerate}
\item Subst and distractor atoms have a weird lifecycle: They start as
  false, then get made true at some point, and then false again.
  After they have been made false, they can never become true again.
\end{enumerate}
