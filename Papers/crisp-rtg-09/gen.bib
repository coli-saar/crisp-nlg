   abstract  =  {
Dependency-based  representations  of  natural  language  syntax  require  a  fine  balance  between  structural  flexibility  and  computational  complexity.  In  previous  work,  several  constraints  have  been  proposed  to  identify  classes  of  dependency  structures  that  are  well-balanced  in  this  sense;  the  best-known  but  also  most  restrictive  of  these  is  projectivity.  Most  constraints  are  formulated  on  fully  specified  structures,  which  makes  them  hard  to  integrate  into  models  where  structures  are  composed  from  lexical  information.  In  this  paper,  we  show  how  two  empirically  relevant  relaxations  of  projectivity  can  be  lexicalized,  and  how  combining  the  resulting  lexicons  with  a  regular  means  of  syntactic  composition  gives  rise  to  a  hierarchy  of  mildly  context-sensitive  dependency  languages.  Our  results  provide  fundamental  insights  into  the  relation  between  structural  properties  of  dependency  representations  and  notions  of  formal  power.

In  this  dissertation,  we  show  that  that  both  the  generative  capacity  and  the  parsing  complexity  of  lexicalized  grammar  formalisms  are  systematically  related  to  structural  properties  of  the  dependency  structures  that  these  formalisms  can  induce.  Dependency  structures  model  the  syntactic  dependencies  among  the  words  of  a  sentence.  We  identify  three  empirically  relevant  classes  of  dependency  structures,  and  show  how  they  can  be  characterized  both  in  terms  of  restrictions  on  the  relation  between  dependency  and  word-order  and  within  an  algebraic  framework.  In  the  second  part  of  the  dissertation,  we  develop  natural  notions  of  automata  and  grammars  for  dependency  structures,  show  how  these  yield  infinite  hierarchies  of  ever  more  powerful  dependency  languages,  and  classify  several  grammar  formalisms  with  respect  to  the  languages  in  these  hierarchies  that  they  are  able  to  characterize.  Our  results  provide  fundamental  insights  into  the  relation  between  dependency  structures  and  lexicalized  grammars.
