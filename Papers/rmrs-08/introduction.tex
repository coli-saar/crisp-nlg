\section{Introduction} \label{sec:introduction}

What we'll do here.  Problem: integrate semantic representations
computed by deep and shallow parsing.  We represent both in RMRS,
which we define cleanly here for the first time.  We also introduce a
model theory for RMRS.  This allows us to define ``compatibility'' of
deep and shallow semantic representations as entailment of RMRS
representations; we define entailment and characterize it
syntactically as extension of solved forms.

just so we have a citation here: \cite{Copestake_etal:MRS}
