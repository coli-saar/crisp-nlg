\section{Robust Minimal Recursion Semantics}
\label{sec:rmrs}

Define syntax of RMRS; model theory of RMRS; solved forms.  Explain
the role of the RMRS models (= trees) in the semantic construction
pipeline, in particular with respect to decoding trees into semantic
representations of the base language formalism.  Present examples in
MRS syntax first, then in our RMRS language.  Finally, compare our
version of RMRS against MRS and dominance constraints.
