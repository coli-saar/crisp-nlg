	Abstract = {We present an efficient algorithm that checks the satisfiability of pure dominance constraints, which is a tree description language contained in several constraint languages studied in computational linguistics. Pure dominance constraints partially describe unlabeled rooted trees. For arbitrary pairs of nodes they specify sets of admissible relative positions in a tree. The task is to find a tree structure satisfying these constraints.   Our algorithm constructs such a solution in time {\$}{$\backslash$}mathcal{\{} O{\}}(m\^{}2){\$} where {\$}m{\$} is the number of constraints. This solves an essential part of an open problem posed by Cornell.   Keywords. Efficient algorithms, tree descriptions, constraint satisfaction},

	Abstract = {This paper proposes an approach to discourse structure that builds on syntactic structure to derive that part of discourse structure that can be captured without taking recourse to deep semantic or conceptual knowledge. This contribution is typically only partial; we intend to capture this partiality in terms of underspecified constraints that describe (but do not enumerate) the structures a given discourse might have. This allows a rather straightforward interface from syntax to discourse and yields a clean interface to modules of discourse resolution.
