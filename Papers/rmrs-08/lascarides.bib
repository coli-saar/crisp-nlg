     We present a new approach to knowledge representation where
     knowledge bases are characterized not in terms of the structures
     they use to represent knowledge, but functionally, in terms of
     what they can be asked or told about some domain.  Starting with
     a representation system that can be asked questions and told
     facts in a full first-order logical language, we then define
     ask- and tell-operations over an extended language that can
     refer not only to the domain but to what the knowledge base
     knows about that domain.  The major technical result is that the
     resulting knowledge, which now includes auto-epistemic aspects,
     can still be represented symbolically in first-order terms.  We
     also consider extensions to the framework such as defaults and
     definitional facilities.  The overall result is a formal
     foundation for knowledge representation which, in accordance
     with current principles of software design, cleanly separates
