\section{RMRS comparison as entailment}
\label{sec:entailment}

Now that we have the formal tools in place, let's go back to the
problem of checking compatibility of semantic outputs.  We can phrase
this as RMRS entailment.  This is progress already.

Then show the representation theorem of entailment as solved form
comparison:

\begin{thm}
  Let $\varphi, \varphi'$ be two RMRSs.  Then $\varphi \models
  \varphi'$ iff for every solved form $S$ of $\varphi$, there is a
  solved form $S'$ of $\varphi'$ such that $S$ is an extension of
  $S'$.
\end{thm}

(Of course, this doesn't give us an efficient algorithm for entailment
checking, because the number of solved forms may be exponential on
each side.  And we still don't know the complexity of deciding
entailment (even for normal dominance constraints).  Nevertheless,
this is nice, because it illustrates that our model theory is both
pretty and useful for proving stuff.)
