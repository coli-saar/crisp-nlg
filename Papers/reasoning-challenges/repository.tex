...and beyond.
What does the centralised repository offer? What does it replace in the
existing setup (central store of domains, blah, blah, blah)... Focus on how
the setup is independent of planning as a research area: we need the same
infrastructure to run a similar competition in other research areas. Build
new bridges to other (related) research areas (may want to put some of this
in a separate discussion section).
